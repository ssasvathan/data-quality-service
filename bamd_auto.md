Read `/home/sas/workspace/data-quality-service/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` and act as the coordinator for the BMAD implementation workflow.

Your job is to fully automate story execution for one epic at a time, selected from the backlog queue, using strict sequential execution and safe failure behavior.

Repository and status rules:
- Use `/home/sas/workspace/data-quality-service/` as the working root.
- Treat `/home/sas/workspace/data-quality-service/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` as the source of truth.
- Build the execution queue from stories whose status is not `done`.
- Determine the target epic from the first non-`done` story encountered in sprint order.
- Only process non-`done` stories belonging to that target epic.
- Process stories one by one, in sprint order.
- Stop when no non-`done` stories remain in the target epic.
- Do not start the next epic.
- Do not run the epic retrospective automatically.
- Wait for a human to handle retrospective and epic advancement.

Story selection rules:
- Re-read `sprint-status.yaml` before selecting each next story.
- Pick the first story in the target epic whose status is not `done`.
- Resume from the selected story's current status instead of restarting from scratch.
- Only work on one story at a time.
- Do not run stories in parallel.

Execution model:
- Act as coordinator only.
- YOU MUST Spawn exactly one fresh worker/sub-agent per workflow step.
- Each step must run in its own fresh context.
- Do not start the next step until the previous step completes successfully.
- If any step fails, stop the entire pipeline immediately and report the failure.
- Do not continue after any such limit error.

Worker lifecycle and stuck detection rules:
- Never send `interrupt=true` to an active worker unless a human explicitly asks for an interrupt.
- Assume BMAD steps can be long-running. Do not treat a short timeout as failure.
- Close worker sessions aggressively to prevent thread exhaustion:
  - As soon as a worker reaches any terminal state (`completed`, explicit failure, capacity/limit error), close that worker immediately after capturing its result.
  - Do not leave completed workers open while launching later steps.
  - Keep at most one active/open worker per current step.
- Default wait policy per step:
  - Use `wait` with long timeout windows (10 minutes each).
  - Keep waiting/polling until success/failure/capacity error is explicit.
- After each timed-out wait, run heartbeat checks before deciding a worker is stuck:
  - Check whether expected artifacts for the current step changed since the last poll (file mtime/content/status movement in story file, sprint-status, runner logs, or implementation files).
  - If heartbeat exists, continue waiting.
- If no heartbeat is observed for 30 consecutive minutes, mark the step as `suspected-stuck` and stop the pipeline safely (no interrupt).
- Before marking `suspected-stuck`, send one non-interrupt status ping (`interrupt=false`) asking for concise progress/final state, then wait one more 10-minute window.
- If a worker session ends unexpectedly but artifacts show the step outcome is complete, run a completion verification checklist and resume from the resulting story status:
  - `bmad-bmm-create-story`: story markdown exists and story status is `ready-for-dev` (or later).
  - `bmad-tea-testarch-atdd`: acceptance tests and status transitions expected by workflow are present.
  - `bmad-bmm-dev-story`: implementation changes and story status advanced to `review` (or later).
  - `bmad-bmm-code-review`: findings report exists and all Critical/High/Medium/Low findings are resolved in code.
  - `bmad-tea-testarch-trace`: traceability artifact/decision output exists.
  - Final gates: both commands passed and pytest skip count is zero.
- If checklist is incomplete or ambiguous, fail safely and stop. Do not guess.

For each selected story, use status-aware entry and run only the remaining steps:
- If story status is `backlog`, run:
  1. `bmad-bmm-create-story`
  2. `bmad-tea-testarch-atdd`
  3. `bmad-bmm-dev-story`
  4. `bmad-bmm-code-review`
  5. `bmad-tea-testarch-trace`
  6. Final quality gates
- If story status is `ready-for-dev`, run:
  1. `bmad-tea-testarch-atdd`
  2. `bmad-bmm-dev-story`
  3. `bmad-bmm-code-review`
  4. `bmad-tea-testarch-trace`
  5. Final quality gates
- If story status is `in-progress`, run:
  1. `bmad-bmm-dev-story`
  2. `bmad-bmm-code-review`
  3. `bmad-tea-testarch-trace`
  4. Final quality gates
- If story status is `review`, run:
  1. `bmad-bmm-code-review`
  2. `bmad-tea-testarch-trace`
  3. Final quality gates

Final quality gates:
   `uv run ruff check`
   `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.docker/desktop/docker.sock uv run pytest -q -rs`

Important workflow requirements:
- Run all BMAD steps in full auto / yolo style.
- Use the exact BMAD names above. Do not substitute shorthand names.
- In `bmad-bmm-code-review`, fix all findings with severity `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, and `Low` before continuing.
- Do not leave unresolved review findings behind.
- Treat any failed test as failure.
- Treat any skipped test as failure.
- The workflow is only successful for a story if all BMAD steps succeed, `ruff` passes, pytest passes, and pytest reports `0 skipped`.

Status synchronization requirements:
- BMAD sometimes forgets to update story/sprint status. Do not assume status was updated correctly.
- After a story completes successfully, explicitly verify and update:
  - the story artifact markdown file
  - `/home/sas/workspace/data-quality-service/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
- Ensure the story ends in the correct final status when all steps and gates pass.
- Do not mark a story `done` unless the full workflow, lint, and zero-skip regression suite all succeed.

Failure behavior:
- On any failure, stop immediately.
- Report:
  - target epic
  - story id
  - workflow step that failed
  - reason for failure
  - whether any files were changed
  - whether sprint/story status was updated or left unchanged
- Do not continue to the next story after a failure.

Successful completion behavior:
- After each successful story, re-read `sprint-status.yaml` and continue to the next remaining non-`done` story in the same target epic.
- When no non-`done` stories remain in the target epic, stop intentionally and report that execution is waiting for human retrospective / epic advancement.

Git commit requirements:
- Only after a successful story workflow execution, create exactly one git commit for changes produced by that story execution.
- Do not create a commit for failed story executions. On failure, stop and report that no commit was created due to failure.
- Commit timing is mandatory:
  - Perform the story commit immediately after that story reaches successful terminal outcome.
  - Do not defer or batch commits across multiple stories.
  - Do not start selecting or executing the next story until the current successful story's commit step is finished (or explicitly reported as `no-op commit`).
- Stage only files changed by that successful story execution. Do not include unrelated pre-existing workspace changes.
- If no files changed for that successful execution, do not create an empty commit; report `no-op commit`.
- Commit message must be explicit and structured:
  - Success: `bmad(<epic>/<story-id>): complete workflow and quality gates`
- Include in the final report:
  - commit hash
  - commit message
  - whether commit was created or `no-op commit` (successful stories only)
  - if failure stop occurred, explicitly state `commit not created due to failure`
- If commit creation fails, stop immediately and report the failure.

Final reporting format:
- Target epic
- Stories completed in this run
- If stopped on failure: failed story, failed step, cause
- If stopped normally: state that there are no remaining non-`done` stories in the target epic and the run is waiting for human retrospective / epic advancement
